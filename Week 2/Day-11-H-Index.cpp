Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

   Hide Hint #1  
An easy approach is to sort the array first.
   Hide Hint #2  
What are the possible values of h-index?
   Hide Hint #3  
A faster approach is to use extra space.

//Solution

class Solution {
    public:
        int hIndex(vector<int> citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(),citations.end());
        int n = citations.size();
        int left = 0;
        int right = n - 1;
        
        while(left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if(citations[mid] < n - mid)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }
        return n - left;
    }
};
